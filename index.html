                <p>Bollywood star Padukone produced and starred in “Chhapaak,” a social drama about the survivor of an acid attack that was released early last year. It was a changeup following from the 2018 period blockbuster “Padmaavat,” in which she plays Queen Padmavati. “I am someone who just goes with my gut,” Padukone says. “Fortunately, I’ve never had to make decisions based on the budget of a film or for various other reasons. It also depends on where I am emotionally in my life.”</p>
